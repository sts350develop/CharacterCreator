You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I have images$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I go to the list of images$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see all the images$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I have no images$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am on the list of images$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I follow "(.*?)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I upload a file$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see "(.*?)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should have (\d+) image$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
